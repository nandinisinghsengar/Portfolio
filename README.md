🧑‍🎨 About This Portfolio

This personal portfolio website is a creative project built to showcase my web development and design skills. The main goal was to create a clean, simple, and fully responsive interface that looks great on any device — from mobile phones to desktops.

The website includes sections for projects, skills, and contact information, allowing visitors to learn more about my work and background.
It’s built entirely with HTML and CSS, using Flexbox and media queries to achieve responsiveness and smooth layout transitions.
